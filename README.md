# Face-Recognition-Attendance-management-System

This project was developed using Python and leveraged the face_recognition library for facial recognition capabilities. The primary goal of this project was to create an efficient and user-friendly system for managing attendance records using facial recognition technology.

Key features of the project included:

Face Recognition: The system used the face_recognition library to recognize and verify the identity of students based on their facial features.

Firebase Integration: Firebase, a popular mobile and web application development platform, was utilized for two main purposes:

Real-time Database: Firebase Realtime Database was used to store student information and attendance records. This allowed for easy and instant updates to attendance data.
Firebase Storage: Firebase Storage was employed to securely store the dataset images used for facial recognition training.
The project aimed to streamline the attendance-taking process in educational institutions, reducing the need for manual record-keeping and the potential for errors. By automating this task with facial recognition technology, it provided a more efficient and accurate solution for attendance management.

The implementation of this project demonstrated the practical application of machine learning and computer vision techniques in a real-world scenario, highlighting the potential for automation and accuracy in various domains, including education.
