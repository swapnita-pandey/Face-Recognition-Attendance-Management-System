# Face-Recognition-Attendance-management-System

Made by using python face_recognition library which uses firebase realtime-database for saving student information and attendance, and firebase storage for saving dataset images.

In this project, I developed a deep learning artificial neural network model to create an efficient attendance management system using facial recognition technology. The project utilized various technologies and services, including Firebase, for a seamless experience.

Key features of the project:

Deep Learning Model: I designed and implemented a deep neural network for facial recognition. This model was trained to recognize and identify students based on their facial features.

Firebase Integration: Firebase was used for its real-time database capabilities. It allowed the system to store and retrieve student information and attendance records swiftly and securely.

Image Dataset Storage: Firebase Storage was employed to securely store the dataset images used for training the facial recognition model. This ensured easy access to the images while maintaining data integrity.

Attendance Management: The system could capture and process images from a camera or image source, identify individuals, and mark their attendance automatically. This streamlined the attendance-taking process.

User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface, making it easy to manage attendance records and view individual attendance histories.

The "Face Recognition Attendance Management System" is a valuable application of machine learning in a practical context, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of attendance tracking while maintaining data security and user convenience.
